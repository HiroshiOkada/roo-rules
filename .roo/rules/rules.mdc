These should be respected ALWAYS:
1. Work on one feature/task at a time - avoid simultaneous changes
2. Follow TDD cycle: Test first, then implement
3. Use Git branching: feature/task-name â†’ main merge
4. Always verify functionality after changes
5. Record important learnings in DEV_LOG.md

IMPROVEMENTS and FURTHER PROGRESSIONS:
- S1: Suggest ways to improve code maintainability for personal projects
- S2: Offer strategies to enhance development speed and workflow
- S3: Recommend methods for better code organization and structure
- Recommend areas for further learning and skill development
